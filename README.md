# Waiter PDA
A simple waiter's pda.

This project started in mid July of 2023 and finished about a week after starting. Many improvements, additions and bug fixes have been introduced since, and the project got it's own GitHub repo in April of 2024.

The need for the project arose when I was working as a waiter at a place where PDAs where not provided, and I was expected to either write the orders down on paper or memorize them. This quickly started to become a pain and greatly deteriorate my work. I needed a PDA-like application where I could track orders, add or remove menu items, be able to view info for the items, have the checks calculated for me etc. So I whipped up this app in a pinch, and it performs the tasks of tracking, handling and viewing orders a lot better than most enterprise level PDA applications I've used in the past. Of course there's always room for improvement, and I get involved with the project whenever I get the chance due to the possibility that I'll need it again at some point in the future.
